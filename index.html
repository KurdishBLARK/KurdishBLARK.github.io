<h2>Why Kurdish language processing?</h2>

</p>

<p align="justify">
  The Kurdish BLARK project started in 2014 by Dr. Hossein Hassani as an adaptation of the original BLARK. He suggested this in his PhD thesis and took the initiative in proposing it as a framework to develop and maintain comprehensive resources and required tools for Kurdish language processing.

  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.ukh.edu.krd/bio.php?stid=9" target="_blank"><b>Hossein Hassani</b></a> is an Assistant Professor at the University of Kurdistan HewlÃªr. He holds a Ph.D. in computer science on the topic of "natural language processing and computational linguistics for Kurdish". As the founder of the Kurdish-BLARK project, he has been supervising projects in KLP. An automatic Kurdish dialects identification system, a Kurdish interdialect machine translation system and the BLARK framework for Kurdish are some of his previous work. He is also a member of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL).

      <a href="https://sinaahmadi.github.io" target="_blank"><b>Sina Ahmadi</b></a> is a Ph.D. student at the Insight Centre for Data Analytics at the National University of Ireland Galway working on natural language processing and machine learning. In 2013, he was a member of the <a href="http://klpp.github.io" target="_blank">Kurdish Language Processing Project (KLPP)</a> where fundamental Kurdish processing tools and resources were created. A Kurdish text transliteration system, KurdNet--the Kurdish WordNet and a Kurdish spell-checker and stemmer are some of his previous work in KLP.

<h2>No wheels to be reinvented!</h2>
<p align="justify">
  The accomplished research in the field of Kurdish language processing and the available resources are still so scanty that it is our firm conviction that only <b>open-source</b> projects can pave the way for further researches in the field. We deeply believe in providing the outcomes of our projects available to the public with open-source licenses so that contributions to the field will be carried out more efficiently by other researchers.

<h2>Join us!</h2>
<p align="justify">
  The Kurdish BLARK warmly welcomes all researchers who are interested in developing Kurdish Language Technology to participate in this initiative.
